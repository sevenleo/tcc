Anitta, son of Pithana, was a king of Kussara, a city that has yet to be identified. He is the earliest known ruler to compose a text in the Hittite language. His high official, or rabi simmiltim, was named Peruwa. . .  Biography . Anitta reigned in the 17th century BC short chronology and is the author of the Anitta text CTH 1.A, edited in StBoT 18, 1974, the oldest known text in the Hittite language and the oldest known IndoEuropean text altogether. This text seems to represent a cuneiform record of Anittas inscriptions at Kanesh, perhaps compiled by Hattusili I, one of the earliest Hittite kings of Hattusa. The Anitta text indicates that Anittas father conquered Nesa Kanesh, Kultepe, which became an important city within the kingdom of Kussara. During his own reign, Anitta defeated Huzziya, the last recorded king of Zalpuwa, and the Hattic king Piyusti and then conquered his capital at the site of the future Hittite capital of Hattusa. He then destroyed the city, sowed the ground with weeds, and laid a curse on the site. Anittas name appears on an inscription on a dagger found in Kultepe and also, together with the name of his father, on various Kultepe texts, as well as in later Hittite tradition. . .  See also . .
